how do you know once you have mastered the basics also how do you know when ai is showing you something that is above the basics ..

Excellent questions—this is where most people stumble without realizing it. Let’s break both down clearly:

🧠 1. How do you know you've mastered the basics?
You’ve mastered the basics when:

✅ You can write small programs without copying code or looking up every step
✅ You can explain what if, for, while, function, and return do and why
✅ You can debug your own mistakes (e.g. “undefined variable” or “infinite loop”)
✅ You understand how to:

Take user input

Work with arrays/lists

Use loops and conditionals

Organize code with functions
✅ You can read someone else’s code and understand 80% of what’s going on
✅ You can build small things like:

A number guessing game

A to-do list

A calculator

A simple timer
...without asking ChatGPT for every line

If that’s you, then you’ve got the basics down.

🚩 2. How do you know when AI is showing you something above the basics?
AI is going beyond the basics when you see things like:

🧠 Concept	Clue it’s advanced
Arrow functions =>	You haven’t learned normal functions yet
async/await, Promise	You haven’t learned how functions return values
.map(), .filter(), .reduce()	You haven’t learned loops or arrays yet
.addEventListener()	You haven’t learned how HTML and JS interact
OOP (class, this)	You haven’t worked with objects or functions yet
try/catch	You haven’t hit runtime errors or thought about error handling yet
Regex, recursion, closures	You don’t know what those words mean yet :)

⚠️ Rule of thumb:
If it has a weird symbol, unfamiliar keywords, or it feels like "AI magic", it’s probably not a basic.

🧩 Pro tip:
When AI gives you code and you don’t understand:

Ask it: “Is this beginner-friendly?” or “What level is this code?”

Or tell it: “Please rewrite this using only beginner concepts (no arrow functions, no map, no async).”

Want me to show you a before/after comparison of beginner vs non-beginner code for something like a timer or to-do app?
